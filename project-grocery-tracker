# Project: Grocery Tracker

Build a personal grocery and vegetables reminder app 
for **your favorite platform: android/ios/mac/win/linux/web**.

The app should let me add items (like rice, oil, onions, tomatoes, etc.) 
along with the quantity I purchased. 

Based on my usage, the app should automatically calculate when 
those items will run out and remind me before running out.

The app is offline-first.

The app should save all data locally. Using a local SQLite database (android). 
It should track purchase history and estimate how many days each item usually lasts. 
Using this data, the app should predict the next time I’ll need to buy that item again.

Features I want:
- Add grocery/vegetable items with name, quantity, unit (kg, litres, etc.)
- Save each purchase with date & quantity
- Track current quantity
- Automatically estimate daily usage
- Predict when an item will run out
- Show a "To Buy Soon" list
- Give reminders/notifications before the item finishes
- Run background checks even if the app is closed
- Everything works offline (data saved locally on device)

Technologies I'm planning to use (android):
- React Native (Bare Workflow)
- SQLite for local storage
- Notifee for notifications
- react-native-background-fetch for background reminders

The goal is to have a simple, smart, offline grocery assistant 
that helps me remember when to buy items before they finish.
